# The Problem Space

Teams need trustworthy device statistics and OS version mix data for planning, reporting, and
audits:

- Roadmaps require a consistent view of device family mix.
- Docs and slides must cite the same sources across teams.
- Automation should not rely on scraping the web at runtime.

Without a curated dataset, every report re-scrapes sources and drifts over time.
