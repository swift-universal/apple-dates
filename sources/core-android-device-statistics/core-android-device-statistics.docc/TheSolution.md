# The Solution

CoreAndroidDeviceStatistics provides a small, static dataset of Android device metrics:

- Structured categories for device families and themes.
- Metrics marked as overall or breakdown data points.
- Metrics that include the value, optional unit, as-of date, and source URLs.

Update workflow

1) Add or refresh metrics as public sources update.
2) Record the authoritative URLs for every value.
3) Keep the dataset small and easy to audit.
